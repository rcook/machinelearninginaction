# Machine Learning in Action in Haskell

This is a fork of Peter Harrington's [Machine Learning in Action][pbharrin]
GitHub repo containing Haskell translations from the original Python sources.

## The plan

I plan to translate as many of the Python examples into Haskell as possible and
to create a package of Haskell support functions (tentatively called
[`mlutil`][mlutil]). I'll then contribute them to the [DataHaskell][dh]
community if they might be of interest to others.
